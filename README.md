# Steam Recommender System

This project involves the development of a **Python-based** **Machine Learning-based Recommender System** focused on predicting user preferences using video game reviews sourced from Steam:

- The initial segment encompasses a play prediction recommender utilizing **Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)** to forecast a user's likelihood of engaging with a specific game or item based on their historical play data.
- Subsequently, a time prediction recommender is implemented, employing a variation of **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** using **TensorFlow** to anticipate the duration a user might spend playing a particular game or item, relying on their historical playtime data.
